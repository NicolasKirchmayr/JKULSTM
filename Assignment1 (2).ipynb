    "In the first assignment, you have to implement the recurrent neural network (RNN) using only NumPy functionality. Concretely, you have to implement the forward and backward pass through the RNN and validate the implementation doing numerical gradient checking. Although you won't most-likely use a self-implemented RNN in real-world applications, this is an excellent task to test and train your understanding of recurrent neural networks in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook contains the core skelleton of everything you have to implement and you will find comments in the code that point you to the exact locations, where you should implement your code. Furthermore, we added type annotations and documentations, where possible, to help you figuring out what the expected inputs are.  \n",
    "**Note:** You are not allowed to use any other package then the packages imported below. Using other packages will be considered cheating and result in a negativ assignment.\n",
